## Background
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

This project is broken into two parts:

    * Part 1: Creating the Earthquake Visualization
    * Part 2: Adding the tectonic plate layer

## Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
    * Import and visualize the USGS data.
    * Create a map using Leaflet that plots all the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.
        * Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.
        * Each point shoud include a popup that provides additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
        * Include a legend that will provide context for map data.

## Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional with no extra points earning)
    * Import a second dataset to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
    * Plot the tectonic plates dataset on the map in addition to the earthquakes.
    * Add other base maps to choose from.
    * Put each dataset into separate overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
    * Add layer controls to the map.
