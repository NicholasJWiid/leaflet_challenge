## Background
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The aim of the project to visualize USGS global earthquake data using Leaflet and Javascript, showing all earthquake locations by size and depth.

The project is broken into two parts:

   * Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
   * Part 2: Add the tectonic plate layer

## Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
   * Import and visualize the USGS data.
   * Create a map using Leaflet that plots all the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.
        * Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.
        * Each point shoud include a popup that provides additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
        * Include a legend that will provide context for map data.

## Part 2: Add the tectonic plate layer
   * Import a second dataset to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
   * Plot the tectonic plates dataset on the map in addition to the earthquakes.
   * Add other base maps to choose from.
   * Put each dataset into separate overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
   * Add layer controls to the map.
